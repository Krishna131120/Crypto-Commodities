- **GRTUSD** also showed significant losses (53 losing trades, -$1,748.58)
- **UNIUSD** had the best performance with 41.8% win rate

### 2. **Low Win Rates**

- **GRTUSD:** 30.3% win rate (23 wins out of 76 closed)
- **UNIUSD:** 41.8% win rate (41 wins out of 98 closed) - Best performer

### 3. **Large Number of Open Positions**

- Total value invested in open positions: ~$3.9 million
- These positions may have unrealized gains/losses not captured in this analysis

### 4. **Trading Activity**

- Heavy concentration in ETH, GRT, and UNI
- Other currencies (BTC, LTC, SHIB, SOL, XRP) have many entries but no exits

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Review Trading Strategy:** The 4.3% win rate on ETHUSD suggests the strategy may not be working well for that asset
2. **Position Management:** Consider closing or adjusting the 855 open positions to realize actual P/L
3. **Risk Management:** The large number of small losing trades suggests stop-losses may be too tight
4. **Focus on Winners:** UNIUSD shows promise with 41.8% win rate - consider allocating more capital there

## NOTES

- This analysis is based on trade data from Alpaca API and local log files
- Open positions are not included in realized P/L calculations
- Cash flow includes both closed and open positions
- Position-based P/L uses FIFO (First In, First Out) matching
- Some discrepancies may exist between log-based and position-based calculations due to timing differences
